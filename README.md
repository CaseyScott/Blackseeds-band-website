((( Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. 
It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used.
Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, 
explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.)))

could be easily missed.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.
